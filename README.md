# Beer Bubbles
Beer bubbles is an interactive animation for a page full of beer bubbles, using [Sketch.js](https://github.com/soulwire/sketch.js)

This was created as a quirky addition to [Beerbot](http://beerbot.vendhq.com)**, Vend HQ's kegbot interface that displays beer at varying levels. The beer needed bubbles, so creating some sweet interactive JavaScript bubbles seemed like a cool idea.

I was originally inspired by this [Bubble Sketch.js Test](http://codepen.io/jackrugile/pen/IjKLt/) codepen, so I updated the colours and bubbliness to be more beerlike in this [Beer Bubbles](http://codepen.io/sehsarah/pen/RPbJOd) fork of mine.

After playing with that initial trial a bit and gathering some feedback from the other Beerbot hackers, we decided we wanted the bubbles to follow the mouse in a more liquid way. I remembered this [Particle Sketch.js Demo](http://soulwire.github.io/sketch.js/examples/particles.html) which felt pretty close to what I was after, so decided to merge those two ideas together.

This is what I came up with.**

**both Beerbot & this project are works in progress, live soon but not yet :)
